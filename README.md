Keepr
=====================

``
ABOUT THE APPLICATION
``


Keepr was designed for users to have a platform to share their keeps "pictures" across the applications with other users.
The application allows users to create albums "vaults" and insert all the keeps they wish to desire. Keepr allows for all users to have public profiles
and have all their keeps and vaults shared to the public, but also gives the option to make vaults private and hidden from other users. A search bar was
implemented to give users an easier and faster way of finding a Keep based on their name.
